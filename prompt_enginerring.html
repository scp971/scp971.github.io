        <h1>Generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI) Prompt Engineering for Additive Manufacturing (AM)</h1>
        <p>This project explores five popular prompt engineering methods: Zero-shot, Few-shot, Chain-of-thought, ReAct, and Directional Stimulus Prompting to address two specific AM tasks</p>
        
        <h2>Project Details</h2>
        <p>To get the desired output from GenAI relies heavily on crafting effective prompts because incorrect formulation of prompts can lead to unexpected responses. Prompt engineering is crucial for GenAI models to produce desired outputs efficiently. In our study, we explore how different prompt techniques affect the responses of GenAI tools in addressing AM problems.  </p>
