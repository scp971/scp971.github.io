        <h1>Project 1: Ontology-based Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) for GenAI-supported Additive Manufacturing</h1>
        <p>This project proposed a ontology-based retrieval augmented generation (RAG) approach to enhance GenAI's capability to generate prompts and answers.</p>
        
        <h2>Project Details</h2>
        <p>Conventional data analytics often fail to capture the intricate context of additive
            manufacturing (AM) processes, leading to pointed solutions and suboptimal analytics outcomes.
            The performance of generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) models, such as large language
            models (LLMs), largely depends on their ability to integrate and contextualize the vast data they
            are trained on. However, contextualizing is often directly driven by the data consumed, and not
            necessarily grounded in the fundamental truths. To address this issue, an ontology-based retrieval
            augmented generation (RAG) approach is proposed to enhance GenAI's capability to generate
            pertinent prompts and answers. The GenAI recognizes and applies relevant context by leveraging
            structured ontology, resulting in accurate and insightful interpretations. A use case showcases how
            the proposed ontology-based RAG framework operates to provide context-aware AM data
            analytics that promote analytical transparency through fundamental truths when executing AM
            data analytics.</p>
